# An Explanation of Neuralink Patents

Lately, I have been carefully digesting patents from Elon Musk's brain-computer interface (BCI) company, [Neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com/). As BCI newbie and an enthusiast, I decided to make a PPT presentation for each of Neuralink's patents up to date, including some algorithmic patents with Python Jupyter notebooks that I've written. For anyone that is just getting into the field of BCI technologies, or want to just simply learn about different fields, hopefully this Github repo can help you. 

Note that this Github repo is to be used for educational purposes only. 

If you have any questions, or want to correct anything from the PPTs (or Jupyter notebooks), please email me at mgz2112@columbia.edu.
