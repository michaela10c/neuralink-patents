# An Explanation of Neuralink Patents

Lately, I have been carefully digesting patents from Elon Musk's brain-computer interface (BCI) company, [Neuralink](https://www.neuralink.com/). As a BCI enthusiast, I decided to make a PPT presentation for each of Neuralink's patents up to date, including some algorithmic patents with Python Jupyter notebooks that I've written. For anyone that is just getting into the field of BCI technologies, or want to just simply learn about different fields, hopefully this Github repo can help you. 

Each Neuralink patent is in a corresponding folder, which includes the *original patent + a PPT describing the patent*. Note that some patents involve algorithmic components, and therefore contain a *Python Jupyter notebook*.

Note that this Github repo is to be used for educational and reference purposes only, as the PPTs (and Jupyter notebooks) are just my interpretation of the concepts involved in this patent. 

If you have any questions, or want to correct anything from the PPTs (or Jupyter notebooks), please email me at mgz2112@columbia.edu.
